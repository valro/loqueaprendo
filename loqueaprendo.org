* Org Mode


** [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/wrap-text-in-an-org-mode-block/][WRAP TEXT IN AN ORG-MODE BLOCK]] 

In my most recent post on org-mode, I talked about using blocks to mark text as being latex, or source code and so on. I mentioned using the shortcuts like <e then TAB on a new line to create an empty block.
Sometimes it is handy to wrap existing text in a block, and the following function does that for the text you have selected.

This has been in my config file for ages and I can’t remember where it came from – I know I didn’t write it! 
A bit of googleing suggests this could be the origin, but if anyone knows different, let me know.

I bind the function to C-< because it reminds me of the < shortcuts to create the blocks, 
and I don’t use the org-cycle-agenda-files that is usually bound to that key combo.

   1. _ncdu_ ((NCurses Disk Usage) provides a navigable overview of file space usage, like an improved du. It opens a read-only vim-like window (press q to quit))
   2. _top_ / _htop_ 
      top displays all currently-running processes and their owners, memory usage, and more. htop is an improved, interactive top. (Note: you can pass the -u username flag to restrict the displayed processes to only those owner by username.)
   3. REPLs
      A REPL is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop, similar to the command line, but usually used for particular programming languages.
      You can open the Python REPL with the python command (and quit with the quit() function):
   4. Environment Variables and Aliases
      
      *Environment variables* (sometimes shortened to "env vars") are persistent variables that can be created and used within your bash shell. They are defined with an equals sign (=) and used with a dollar sign ($). You can see all currently-defined env vars with _printenv_:

* MSYS2-MINGW 

** [[https://www.booleanworld.com/get-unix-linux-environment-windows-msys2/][How to Get an Unix/Linux Environment on Windows with MSYS2]]

*** Adding MSYS2 to your PATH variable
   
    The MSYS2 tools (and that includes tools like grep) won’t be available if you don’t launch them through the Start Menu shortcut. To make them available everywhere, you need to add them to the “Path” variable like so:
    1. Open the Run box by pressing Windows + R, and type in _systempropertiesadvanced_.
    2. Click on the “Environment Variables” button.
    3. In the “System Variables” section, scroll down and double-click on the “Path” variable.
    4. If you’re on Windows 10, add the _C:\msys64\usr\bin_, and move this entry to the top.

*** The difference between MinGW32/64 and MSYS2
    
    From the MinGW shell, run:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    declare > mingw-config
    #+END_SRC
    Again, run this from the MSYS2 shell:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    declare > msys2-config
    #+END_SRC
    
    Now, you can diff these files to see the differences in environment variables. Here we’ve only shown what has changed; the actual diff is a whole lot longer.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    diff mingw-config msys2-config
    #+END_SRC


* Bash Ubuntu in Windows 10

** Change directory
   
   WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) stores your Windows drives in the /mnt folder, with the name of the drive as a subfolder.
   For example your C:\ drive will be present at /mnt/c/ for you to use.

   Keeping this in mind, you can swap to your specific folder like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd /mnt/c/users/admi00895tq
   #+END_SRC

   Rectangle commands operate on rectangular areas of the text: all the characters between a certain pair of columns, in a certain range of
   lines. Emacs has commands to kill rectangles, yank killed rectangles, clear them out, fill them with blanks or text, or delete them. Rectangle
   commands are useful with text in multicolumn formats, and for changing text into or out of such formats.

    When you are collecting text using append-to-register and

    pieces using a separator. In that case, configure a register-separator
    and store the separator text in to that register. For example, to get
    double newlines as text separator during the collection process, you
    can use the following setting.

* Hashes in books

The *intra hash* is relatively strict and takes into account the fields /title, author, editor, year, entrytype, journal, booktitle, volume, and number/. 
This allows a user to have articles with the same title from the same authors in the same year but in different volumes (e.g. a technical report and the corresponding journal article).

In contrast, the *inter hash* is less specific and only includes title, year, and author or editor (depending on what the user has entered).

In both hashes, all fields which are taken into account are normalized, i.e., certain special characters are removed, whitespace and author/editor names normalized. The latter is done by concatenating the first letter of the first name by a dot with the last name, both in lower case. Persons are then sorted alphabetically by this string and concatenated by a colon.

Source code

The computation of the hashes is done in the class 
_org.bibsonomy.model.util.SimHash_
It contains the following code to compute the intra hash:

#+BEGIN_SRC java

public static String getSimHash2(final BibTex bibtex) {
       return StringUtils.getMD5Hash(StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(bibtex.getTitle())     + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(PersonNameUtils.serializePersonNames(bibtex.getAuthor(), false))    + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(PersonNameUtils.serializePersonNames(bibtex.getEditor(), false))    + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(bibtex.getYear())      + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(bibtex.getEntrytype()) + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(bibtex.getJournal())   + " " + 
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLettersOrDotsOrSpace(bibtex.getBooktitle()) + " " +
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLetters(bibtex.getVolume())                 + " " +
          StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLetters(bibtex.getNumber())
       );
    }

#+END_SRC

The following code is responsible to compute the inter hash:

#+BEGIN_SRC java

public static String getSimHash1(final BibTex publication) {
    if (!present(StringUtils.removeNonNumbersOrLetters(PersonNameUtils.serializePersonNames(publication.getAuthor())))) {
       // no author set --> take editor
       return StringUtils.getMD5Hash(getNormalizedTitle(publication.getTitle()) + " " +
          PersonNameUtils.getNormalizedPersons(publication.getEditor())            + " " +
          getNormalizedYear(publication.getYear()));
    }
    // author set
    return StringUtils.getMD5Hash(getNormalizedTitle(publication.getTitle()) + " " + 
         PersonNameUtils.getNormalizedPersons(publication.getAuthor())            + " " + 
         getNormalizedYear(publication.getYear()));
}

*** Preface

“Honesty in small things is not a small thing.”

God is in the details, said the architect Ludwig mies van der Rohe

Why? Because small things matter.

One of the major pillars of  TPM_ (Totasl Production Maintenance) is the set of so-called 5S principles

The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts:

- Seiri, or organization (think “/sort/” in English). Knowing where things are—using approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. You think naming identifiers isn’t important? Read on in the following chapters.

- Seiton, or tidiness (think “/systematize/” in English). There is an old American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.

- Seiso, or cleaning (think “/shine/” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them.

- Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.

- Shutsuke, or discipline ( self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.

I think it’s important to note that the Danish wisdom advises us not just to pay attention to small things, but also to be  honest  in small things. This means being honest to the code, honest to our colleagues about the state of our code and, most of all, being honest with ourselves about our code.

Be prepared to work hard while reading this book. This is not a “feel good” book that you can read on an airplane and finish before you land. This book will make you work,  and work hard. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code.

*** Chapter 1. Clean Code

**** There Will Be Code
     - Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the require-
ments. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools
that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will
never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.

**** Bad Code
     
     Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then—why did you write it?
     Were you trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Probably so. Perhaps you felt that you
     didn’t have time to do a good job; that your boss would be angry with you if you took the
     time to clean up your code. Perhaps you were just tired of working on this program and
     wanted it to be over. Or maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that you had prom-
     ised to get done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you could
     move on to the next. We’ve all done it.

**** The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

     As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically
     approaching zero.

**** The Grand Redesign in the Sky
    
     If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then you already
know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of
professional survival.

**** Attitude

     We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types
and telephone sanitizers. But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.
We are unprofessional.
     So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t
understand the risks of making messes.

**** The Primal Conundrum

     The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

**** The Art of Clean Code?
     
     So too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!
     Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied
     through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.”
     In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen
     through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.

**** What Is Clean Code?

     *Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language:*
     
     "I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard 
     for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete
     according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt
     people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing
     well."
     
     /Elegant/. /Pleasing/. /Efficiency/
     Bjarne also mentions that error handing should be complete. This goes to the disci-
     pline of paying attention to details. Abbreviated error handling is just one way that pro-
     grammers gloss over details.
     
     *Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with
     Applications*

     "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code
     reads like well-written prose. Clean code never
     obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full
     of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines
     of control."

     /readability perspective/

     *“Big” Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy*

     "Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a
     developer other than its original author. It has
     unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful
     names. It provides one way rather than many
     ways for doing one thing. It has minimal depen-
     dencies, which are explicitly defined, and pro-
     vides a clear and minimal API. Code should be
     literate since depending on the language, not all
     necessary information can be expressed clearly
     in code alone."

     /Dave asserts that clean code makes it easy for other people to enhance it./
     /Smaller is better./

     /Dave also says that code should be literate./

     *Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code*

     "I could list all of the qualities that I notice in
     clean code, but there is one overarching quality
     that leads to all of them. Clean code always
     looks like it was written by someone who cares.
     There is nothing obvious that you can do to
     make it better. All of those things were thought
     about by the code’s author, and if you try to
     imagine improvements, you’re led back to
     where you are, sitting in appreciation of the
     code someone left for you—code left by some-
     one who cares deeply about the craft."

     /How to Care for Code/

     *Ron Jeffries, author of Extreme Programming Installed and Extreme Programming 
     Adventures in C#*
    
     *Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki, inventor of Fit, coinventor of eXtreme Programming. Motive force behind Design Patterns. Smalltalk and OO
     thought leader. The godfather of all those who care about code.* 

**** The Boy Scout Rule

     The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule that we can apply to our profession.
Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

*** Modes

**** an excellent package for most web-focused languages: [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/nXhtml][nXhtml - Emacs wiki]]
**** To get a complete list of all modes running and all the keybindings they introduce, type C-h m

*** Evaluating changes and new code

     + M-x eval-region
     + M-x eval-buffer
     + To evaluate one piece of code individually: C-M-x
     + To evaluate block of code in org-mode: C-c C-c

*** Line numbers

    - to enable line numbers in the margin of the active buffer by running _M-x linum-mode_
    - To enable it globally for all buffers run _M-x global-linum-mode_
    - To enable it globally and permanently add this to your .emacs file: _(global-linum-mode 1)_
    - Now you can customize it further with: _M-x customize-group RET linum RET_

*** "Interactively Do Things" IDO Mode

    Basically it makes switching between buffers (and optionally files) really easy as you simply type parts of a name and Ido will automatically narrow the list to just the ones matching the search text.
    
    I recommend you put this in your .emacs file:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (ido-mode 1)
    (setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
    
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : t

    IF you want Ido mode to work with C-x C-f (find-files) then add this as well:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (setq ido-everywhere t)
    
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : t

*** Hiding the splash screen and banner

    Emacs by default will pester you with a splash screen and a message in the echo area. To disable both, and have emacs default to its *scratch* buffer, add this to your .emacs:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (setq inhibit-startup-message t
          inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)  
    
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : t

*** Rebinding the CAPS LOCK key

    - MS Windows I recommend [[https://www.randyrants.com/2008/12/sharpkeys_30/][SharpKeys, a free tool that permanently rebinds the keys.]]
    - On Linux you can use xmodmap or the ‘System -> Prefs -> Keyboard’ section if you’re using Ubuntu and Gnome.
    - And finally, to make up for the fact that you no longer have a CAPS LOCK key I suggest learning the following keys instead:
    - [[http://wiki.c2.com/?RemapCapsLock][Remap Caps Lock with xmodemap with examples]]

    To UPCASE A REGION type C-x C-u; to UPCASE a single word, type M-u
    To downcase a region type C-x C-l; to downcase a single word, type M-l
    To Capitalize A Region type M-x capitalize-region; to Capitalize a single word, type M-c

*** Making Emacs Auto Indent
    
    I prefer to enable it globally and then disable it locally for each mode I do not like.
    Here’s how you would enable it globally:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (define-key global-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
    
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : newline-and-indent

*** How do I customize the Font and Background    

    - To customize the default font and color, type M-x customize-face RET default RET.
    - To customize the default syntax highlighter (also called “font locking”) typeM-x customize-group RET font-lock-faces RET.

*** Undoing changes
    _C-x u_ or C_

*** Loading New Packages

*** Setting up your load path
    
    Your load path is where Emacs will search for files to load.
    To inspect the load path you can type _C-h v load-path_ RET.
    Add this to your .emacs, substituting the example path below with one of your own choosing. 
    I recommend ~/.emacs.d/ or another sub-directory to your home directory.
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    ;; You can change the path here
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/myelisp")

    Now that you’ve added a custom path you can put your files in there. 
    If your package has lots of files and its own directory structure 
    you can go ahead and explicitly instead.

*** Loading the package

    Emacs can load files in one of several ways:
      - By invoking _(require 'feature)_ if the package has _(provide 'feature)_ somewhere in the file.
      - By explicitly calling _(load-library "packagefilename")_. 
        I would recommend this unless you know the name of the feature provided by the package.
	#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

	(load-library "column-marker.el")
	
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: t

*** Testing that it worked

    You can switch to the buffer *Messages* and see if you can spot any errors.
    Now you’re ready to use your new package.

*** Conclusion

    I recommend reading my article series Effective Editing in Emacs.
