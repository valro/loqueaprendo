/*
 *Write a program that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then
 *prints the number with its digits reversed. A session with the
 *program should have the following appearance:
 *
 *Enter a two-digit number: 28
 *The reversal is: 82
 *
 *Read the number using %d, then break it into two digits. 
 *Hint: If n is an integer, then n % 10 is the last digit in n and  
 *n/10  is n with the last 
 *digit removed.
