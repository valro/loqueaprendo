* The message function examples

  (message "The name of this buffer is : %s" (buffer-name))

  (message "The value of fill-column is %d. " fill-column)  

  (message "The are %d %s in the office" (- fill-column 14) "pink elephants")

  finally, here is a somewhat complex example

  (message "He saw %d %s"
            (- fill-column 32)
	    (concat "red " 
	            (substring
		     "The quick brown foxes jumped," 16 21)
		     " leaping."))
 
** Setting the Value of a Variable
*** Using set
    (set 'flowers '(rose violet daisy buttercup)) 
*** Using setq
    (setq carnivores '(lion tiger leopard))
    (setq trees '(pine oak maple)
          hervibores '(gazelle antelope zebra))
*** Counting
    (setq counter 0)                  ; Let's call this initializer
    (setq counter (+ counter 1))      ; This is the increment
** Exercises
   ;; Create a counter that increments by two rather than one
   (setq counter-two 0)
   (setq counter-two (+ counter-two 2))
   ;; Write an expression that prints a message in the echo area when evaluated
   (message "The counter has a value %d" counter-two)
* Practicing evaluation
** Buffer Names
   (buffer-name)
   (buffer-file-name)
** Getting Buffers
   (current-buffer)
   (other-buffer)
** Switching Buffers
   (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))
** Buffer Size and the Location of Point
   (buffer-size)      ; returns a count of the number of characters in the buffer
   (point)
   (point-min)
   (point-max)
** Exercise
